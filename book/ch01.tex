  Below we discuss some fundamental structuring ideas at Socotra.

\section{Fundamental Objects}
Of the objects in the simplified schema products, policies and modifications are the most common topics
of discussion. A $Product$ is merely a compound, tree structured definition object. It is mostly static,
configuration data, not very computationally exciting. A $Policy$ and its $Modification$ set is much more
interesting and dynamic. And at Socotra the two are used very much like the common functional list type
\begin{equation*}
  data \; List \; a = Nil | Cons \; a
\end{equation*}
To make the analogy more explicit, I will rewrite the above as
\begin{equation*}
  data \; Policy \; a = Init | Modification  \; a
\end{equation*}
The analogy is not quite exact but it brings out an important idea that the meat of what a $Policy$ is and
how it behaves during computation is determined by the time ordered list of modifications that it is made up
of.

Below I have added some additional notes, to give a more detailed, but still simplified, understanding of
the structure of policies and modifications.
