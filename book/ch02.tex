\abstract{During the course of a policy's lifetime it may be necessary to cancel a policy because invoices have not been paid or for other
  business reasons. These same policies may then need to be restored to their state before the cancellation. The cancellation and
  renewal functionality in the Socotra system handles these policy changes. \newline\indent
  The functionality operates through two distinct mechanism. The first is though API which customers use to trigger cancellations or reinstatements.
  There is also a group of automated jobs which can cancel a policy or reinstate it when a policies state satisfies certain lifecycle conditions.

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:02:1}
In our discussion of policies so far we dealt with the modifications
\begin{equation*}
  \{Creation, Endorsement, Renewal\}.
\end{equation*}
To this set we now
add the modifications
\begin{equation*}
  \{Cancellation, Reinstatement\}.
\end{equation*}
These new modifications are similiar to modifications we already
know, with slight differences. Reinstatements are different in that they have two unique fields, described below, and Cancellations
are different in that their state lifecycle only has the two events onCreate and onIssue. Below is the general context in which
we can start to model the cancellation and renewal module.

With the new modifications modeled we can now lay out actions on our policy in the usual state centric way. Cancellations with have
onCreate and onIssue events that they respond to. And Reinstatements respond to onCreate, onAccept and onIssue events.
