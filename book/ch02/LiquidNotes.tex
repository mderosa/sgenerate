When primitive Java types are passed to JRuby they are converted to the following Ruby types:

\begin{tabular}{l l}
  Java Type & Ruby Type \\
  \toprule
  public String & String \\
  public byte & Fixnum \\
  public short & Fixnum \\
  public char & Fixnum \\
  public int & Fixnum \\
  public long & Fixnum \\
  public float & Float \\
  public double & Float
\end{tabular}

The Java Booleans true and false are coerced to the Ruby singleton classes TrueClass and FalseClass
which are represented in Ruby with the instances true and false.
The null Java object is coerced to the Ruby class NilClass which is represented in Ruby as the instance nil.
