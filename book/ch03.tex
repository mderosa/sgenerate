\section{Characteristics}
\label{sec:03:1}

Characteristics are containers that track a set attribute values
(number\_of\_drivers = 2, make\_of\_car = Honda, resale\_value=10000)
which a policy contract is based on, and additionally a time interval over which
those attribute values are valid. Its a combination of a map and a time
interval. 

Below we just consider the time interval part of a characteristics and detail
how those intervals split as the standard modification operations are applied
to intervals
