\section{Grace and Lapse}
\label{sec:jobs:1}
In addition to cancellations that can happen through the API, it's also possible to policies to be canceled automatically by
the system. This automated cancellation happens when a policy has outstanding invoices which have not been paid. The system
scheduled grace job flags outstanding invoices and the scheduled lapse job after some time will eventually cancel the policies
associated with those flagged invoices. Below is a simplified model of the process, which details the essential points of
understanding for the jobs.
